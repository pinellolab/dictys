	This is an modified version of the Fruchterman-Reingold layout function. (from networkx import fruchterman_reingold_layout)
	This function allows the user to get layout information before it fully converges with the "stop" parameter
	The function also allows for finer steps for each iteration using "iterations" and "pretendIterations"
	pretendIterations (int) = the max number of iterations run in the original function; the ratio of pretendIterations/iterations is the ratio of step sizes between the edited and original functions
	
	stop (int) = the number of iterations run before the returned layout stops prematurely
	Documention below is from the original FR function:
	Position nodes using Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm.
	The algorithm simulates a force-directed representation of the network
	treating edges as springs holding nodes close, while treating nodes
	as repelling objects, sometimes called an anti-gravity force.
	Simulation continues until the positions are close to an equilibrium.
	There are some hard-coded values: minimal distance between
	nodes (0.01) and "temperature" of 0.1 to ensure nodes don't fly away.
	During the simulation, `k` helps determine the distance between nodes,
	though `scale` and `center` determine the size and place after
	rescaling occurs at the end of the simulation.
	Fixing some nodes doesn't allow them to move in the simulation.
	It also turns off the rescaling feature at the simulation's end.
	In addition, setting `scale` to `None` turns off rescaling.
	Parameters
	----------
	G : NetworkX graph or list of nodes
		A position will be assigned to every node in G.
	k : float (default=None)
		Optimal distance between nodes.  If None the distance is set to
		1/sqrt(n) where n is the number of nodes.  Increase this value
		to move nodes farther apart.
	pos : dict or None  optional (default=None)
		Initial positions for nodes as a dictionary with node as keys
		and values as a coordinate list or tuple.  If None, then use
		random initial positions.
	fixed : list or None  optional (default=None)
		Nodes to keep fixed at initial position.
		ValueError raised if `fixed` specified and `pos` not.
	iterations : int  optional (default=50)
		Maximum number of iterations taken
	threshold: float optional (default = 1e-4)
		Threshold for relative error in node position changes.
		The iteration stops if the error is below this threshold.
	weight : string or None   optional (default='weight')
		The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used for
		the edge weight.  If None, then all edge weights are 1.
	scale : number or None (default: 1)
		Scale factor for positions. Not used unless `fixed is None`.
		If scale is None, no rescaling is performed.
	center : array-like or None
		Coordinate pair around which to center the layout.
		Not used unless `fixed is None`.
	dim : int
		Dimension of layout.
	seed : int, RandomState instance or None  optional (default=None)
		Set the random state for deterministic node layouts.
		If int, `seed` is the seed used by the random number generator,
		if numpy.random.RandomState instance, `seed` is the random
		number generator,
		if None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
		by numpy.random.
	Returns
	-------
	pos : dict
		A dictionary of positions keyed by node
